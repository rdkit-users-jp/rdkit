"By default, the RDKit applies its own model of aromaticity (explained in "

"The easiest way to do this is it provide the molecules as SMILES with the"

"For shape comparison, the RDKit provides two Shape-based distances that "

"The RDKit provides an implementation of the torsion fingerprint deviation"
" (TFD) approach developed by Schulz-Gasch et al. (J. Chem. Inf. Model, "
"52, 1499, 2012). For a pair of conformations of a molecule, the torsional"
" angles of the rotatable bonds and the ring systems are recorded in a "
"torsion fingerprint (TF), and the deviations between the TFs calculated, "
"normalized and summed up. For each torsion, a set of four atoms a-b-c-d "

"For the conformer RMS and TFD values, the RDKit provides convenience "

"The goal is to be able to use custom atom types in the MCS code, yet "
